== Knative major concepts

. Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform that helps to run your serverless work‐loads in the BaaS way
. Knative was started with the simple goal of having a Kubernetes-native platform to build, deploy, and manage your serverless workloads
. On Knative you can deploy any modern application workload, such as monolithic applications, microservices, or even tiny functions
. Like any other Kubernetes resource, a Knative Serving Service can be deployed using a resource YAML file.
As you will see, the resource YAML is similar to a Kubernetes Deployment but with a few attributes removed.

== Enable Knative on Minishift

[source,bash]
----
# memory for the vm
minishift config set memory 8GB

# the vCpus for the vm
minishift config set cpus 4

# extra disk size for the vm
minishift config set disk-size 50g

# caching the images that will be downloaded during app deployments
minishift config set image-caching true

# Add new user called admin with password with role cluster-admin
minishift addons enable admin-user

# Allow the containers to be run with uid 0
minishift addons enable anyuid

# Start minishift
minishift start

eval $(minishift docker-env) && eval $(minishift oc-env)

#
oc login -u admin -p admin
oc login -u developer -p welcome1
----

== Enable SCCs (Security Context Constraints)

[source,bash]
----
oc project myproject
# Set privileged and anyuid scc to default SA in myproject
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n myproject
----

== Deploy Knative commands

. API K8s used to deploy Knative on Minishift is *_serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1_*

[source,bash]
----
# same command to kubectl, the deploy take a slight more time that normal deploy
watch oc get pods
oc -n myproject get ksvc greeter
oc get configurations greeter
----

== Invoking the current

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
KSVC_NAME=${1:-'greeter'}
IP_ADDRESS="$(minikube ip):$(kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway \
--namespace istio-system \
--output 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')"
curl -H "Host:$KSVC_NAME.chapter-2.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS
oc ip
watch -n 5 http greeter-00000-service-myproject.192.168.42.30.nip.io/
----

.Knative Service Invoked by Router from OKD

== _Knative Serving Interaction_

****
You should notice that if your ksvc pod called greeter is not inter‐ acted with (i.e., not called/invoked), it will terminate as Knative Serving will automatically #_scale-to-zero_# any Knative Service pods that are not being actively used.
If needed, $BOOK_HOME/bin/call.sh will wake up greeter, causing it to scale back up to an actively run‐ ning pod.
You can use watch kubectl get pods to monitor the pod lifecycle
****

[source,bash]
----
oc get revisions
----

== Knative Autoscaling features

. Scale out, means increase up your instances based on inbound HTTP traffic
. Knative Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (KPA)
. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA); the default autoscaler built into Kubernetes, HPA relies on three important metrics: concurrency, requests per second, and cpu

.Config-map file to configure Knative Service for Autoscaling
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  container-concurrency-target-default: "100"
  enable-scale-to-zero: "true"
  stable-window: "60s"
  scale-to-zero-grace-period: "30s"
----

. This config-map exists on knative-serving ns, to check

[source,bash]
----
# kubectl or oc
oc -n knative-serving get cm config-autoscaler -o yaml
----

. #_The time period in which the requests are monitored for calls and metrics; defaults to 60 seconds_#
. #_The time period within which the inactive pods are terminated; defaults to 30 seconds_#
. When another request targets an inactive Revision, the activator intercepts that request and will instruct the Knative autoscaler to create new pods for that service Revision.
. Handle Requests Spikes
. Avoid Coldstart Latency with minScale and maxScale
. By default does not set an upper limit to the number of pods (maxScale fix this)

== Knative Serving

. Knative has two major subprojects: Serving and Eventing, with Serving you have dynamic autoscaling, including scaling down to zero pods, based on the absence of HTTP traffic load, and Eventing, you now have that same autoscaling capability but bridged into other protocols or from other sour‐ ces beyond HTTP

=== Usage Patterns

Source to Sink

 1.Source to Sink provides the simplest getting started experience with Knative
 2.Eventing. It provides single Sink—that is, event receiving service

Channels and Subscriptions

 With Channels and Subscriptions, the Knative Eventing system defines a Channel, which can connect to various backends, each Channel can have one or more Subscribers in the form of Sink Services

Brokers and Triggers

 Brokers and Triggers are similar to Channels and Subscriptions, except that they support filtering of events event filtering is a method that allows the Subscribers to show an interest in a certain set of messages that flows into the Broker


=== Minikube Knative Configuration


[source,bash]
----
minikube config set cpus 4
minikube config set memory 8192

minikube start

minikube addons enable registry
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


# After Knative Installations
kubectl api-resources --api-group=kafka.strimzi.io
kubectl label nodes kind-control-plane my-label=sample
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' -n knative-serving
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=knative-cookbook


minikube stop && minikube delete --all && minikube delete --purge
----

=== All Knative Eventing resources will be under the one of following API groups:

- messaging.knative.dev
- eventing.knative.dev
- sources.knative.dev

[source,bash]
----
kubectl api-resources --api-group='serving.knative.dev'
kubectl api-resources --api-group='messaging.knative.dev'
kubectl api-resources --api-group='eventing.knative.dev'
----

kubectl get svc kourier -n kourier-system --output 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}'
kubectl -n knative-cookbook get ksvc greeter

curl -H "Host:greeter.knative-cookbook.example.com" 192.168.49.2:32498

=== Strimzi Kafka Cluster

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace kafka
curl -L https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases/download/0.29.0/strimzi-cluster-operator-0.29.0.yaml | sed 's/namespace: .*/namespace: kafka/' | kubectl apply -f - -n kafka

watch kubectl get pods -n kafka
